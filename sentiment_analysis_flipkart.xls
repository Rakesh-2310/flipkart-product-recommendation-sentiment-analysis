5,Terrific,this was an awesome buy. i bought this phone for my father who was upgrading from an iphone 6. he is very happy with this phone. the size is really good. he said that it was even more comfortable to hold than the 6 as it had flat sides. it is smaller than most android phones but big enough for anything and everything...the performance is stellar. you won't notice any lag and it's very fast. ram management is good too. and the phone stays at a reasonable temperature even when using gmaps...the battery life is good. not as good as most android phones but the efficiency of this processor is really good. you will have to buy a charger for 1800 rupees and that is a genuine inconvenience. even though it charges at a good rate when charged using my mac mini usb c port...the camera is awesome. it takes some awesome photos and the video is just pure wizardry. it drains battery pretty fast while recording 4k videos which is expected due to the heavy processing and hdr it is doing. 30 fps videos can be shot at dolby vision hdr...the display doing 60hz is fine. it's very bright and sharp. you will get used to the notch in no time. 120hz would've been appreciated though. speakers too are awesome. stereo speakers make it very enjoyable. the haptics is next level and i am very happy with it.,iPhone 12,30999,MGJ83HN/A,0.9974,positive,positive,0.4298875661375661,positive

5,Brilliant,"i have been using the pixel 8 for 2 months. here is my experience so far. i'll divide the review in pros and cons..pro:.1. camera: so far this is the proper point and shoot camera. just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. compared to samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation..2. ui: there's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. i'll have to say they are right about it. it was a great experience using it any day. if you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by ota updates..3. battery: there's a catch here. just use it for like a week in the beginning. it will be very bad but after a week i don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. i'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email..4. looks: it is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. it looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone..cons:.1. charging: i'm using the google 30w charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. it initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow..2. heat: if you're on 5g network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. same goes for gaming as well..3. accessories: they are hard to find in market. provided by companies like spigen and google are quite expensive. screen guard is a hard match to find..4. network: not much of a issue for me. i've using a vi and an airtel sim in it. all i can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes..update after 1 month:.1. heating issues: its resolved quite a lot. i hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging..2. screen: i recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. it much brighter than iphones for sure..3.ai features: i've not used like every ai features but i've used magic eraser and it works very good. feels as if it was photoshopped by someone..even used it with videos. it erases the background noises very professionally.",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.9955,positive,positive,0.11353281853281856,positive

5,Must buy!,"i got it yesterday; there is a difference between warm and hot! it feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(this is my true experience in one day whole usage). kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. it's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. camera, believe me unbeatable! battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! nope. all other experience again top notch. when you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). and yes, people notice and asks about pixel. some are even crazy for it. ü§ó i was scared before buying but i'm glad now. i had manifested that i will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! ü•∞ concluding: please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are fake! i'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! go for pixel anyday!üôè",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.8984,positive,positive,0.2017463235294118,positive

4,Value-for-money,"whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. if you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price..pros:-..cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. the raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. i would say photos are better than the iphones. videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion ai features this phone comes with...software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure android experience. although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates..display and design: display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. one handed usable phone..cons:-..network connectivity: downright bad, i continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. can't even make calls or do upi transactions in some places. in my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me...performance: as i am not a heavy gamer, i can't say anything on the gaming front but i did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. but to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. battery is average tho.",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.0108,positive,positive,0.17794261294261296,positive

4,Nice product,"initial impressions (its been about three days since i got the phone).the phone looks and feels great. better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by google). definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples..the camera lives up to the hype. realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures..the display is amazing, the ui is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. the speakers are loud and good. however, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. not that big of a problem..ai features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better..so many customisation options on the pure android make the phone feel like a delight....however, there are a few drawbacks. the battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but i'm only a moderate user. anything more and i need to recharge it atleast once during the day..the charging is slow. i moved from a poco 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with google's official charger and cable..the phone does heat up - it's not that bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. it's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. however it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. the phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. even when idle, it's warm. warm. not hot to be really honest...i have not found any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - i get data in places i did not previously receive). performance with games (i don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 mb type of games) is also good and smooth. no issues there either...all in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.9879,positive,positive,0.13276998299319726,positive

5,Highly recommended,"google has an overall winner with pixel 8..i have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and i will say i am totally impressed by what you get on the phone..if google stands by its claim of 7 years of os update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell...pros:.1. performance is smooth. it is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. i haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. all app use experience has been top notch. but if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere..2. very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. this probably even beats the iphone in this department..3. wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use..4. battery life has improved quite a bit. it took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. around 7 hrs of sot with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. lets see how it holds up in the long term. overall very nice!!.5. the cameras and google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. you get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. the hdr mode is very good. and the portraits are also coming out good. i loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range..6. the screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight..7. i did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much...cons:.1. me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations..2. the finger print sensor is average. face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions..3. speakers could have been better..4. doesn't work with airtel 5g yet. but it may be airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5g section as of this writing..5. price is too high, should have been around 55k. not sure what google was thinking about that...overall a very well executed phone by google but the price can be a bummer for many. i would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with google phones.",Google Pixel 8,38999,GPJ41,0.9981,positive,positive,0.2647397891963109,positive

4,Worth the price,"edit: review after 17 months usage.there are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user..cons:.1. battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, i'm not a heavy user but if i'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. a hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day..2. samsung is providing 45w charging speed for the plus and ultra models but only 25w for s23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive..3. screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition...pros.1. the camera, is hands down one the best in the market. see with still photos many android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of s23 so i won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny..2. performance is just great, sd 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. i'm glad samsung skipped exynos for s23..3. design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. its size is perfect for one-hand use. also, i love the new standardized look samsung is going with all of its phones..4. the flagship experience is best with samsung. a 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time..5. samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more samsung devices and windows pc then you get something closer to apple's ecosystem. phone-link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam..6. with one ui 6.1 the software experience has become even better. the phone feels way more polished now...at current market price s23 is highly recommended.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.9931,positive,positive,0.34591815591815595,positive

4,Good choice,"after almost 15 days of usage, samsung s23 has lived up to my expectations. the obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. during the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. it still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming..one suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 gb may seem to be a little short in storage. the ai based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.8225,positive,positive,0.1172979797979798,positive

5,Awesome,"camera and overall features are nice. if you are into photography, can download expert raw app by samsung and try to enhance your skills. night clicks are also coming out quite good. processor is superfast. intensive usage is leading to heating but not into an alarming condition. but bit heating is there while you are going all out. overall size is quite handy which i admire a lot. but the major drawback is the battery which is not upto the mark comparing to i phone 14.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999,SM-S911BZEBINS,0.8441,positive,positive,0.20396634615384615,positive
