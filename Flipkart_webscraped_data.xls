5,Brilliant,"It‚Äôs my first iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in college‚úåÔ∏è..I am a tech freak so you can trust my views -.- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date.- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos..- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real..- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music.- iOS has no bugs at all.- 20W charging is lit üî•.- The Face ID feels like having no lock for yourself, there‚Äôs no issue while using Face ID even in the dark because it uses infrared rays to scan the face..Drawbacks -.- Battery could be better",iPhone 12,30999

5,Terrific,This was an awesome buy. I bought this phone for my father who was upgrading from an iPhone 6. He is very happy with this phone. The size is really good. He said that it was even more comfortable to hold than the 6 as it had flat sides. It is Smaller than most android phones but big enough for anything and everything...The performance is Stellar. You won't notice any lag and it's very fast. Ram management is good too. And the phone stays at a reasonable temperature even when using Gmaps...The battery life is good. Not as good as most android phones but the efficiency of this processor is really good. You will have to buy a charger for 1800 rupees and that is a genuine inconvenience. Even though it charges at a good rate when charged using my mac mini usb c port...The camera is awesome. It takes some awesome photos and the video is just pure wizardry. It drains battery pretty fast while recording 4k videos which is expected due to the heavy processing and HDR it is doing. 30 fps videos can be shot at dolby vision HDR...The display doing 60hz is fine. It's very bright and sharp. You will get used to the notch in no time. 120hz would've been appreciated though. Speakers too are awesome. Stereo speakers make it very enjoyable. The haptics is next level and i am very happy with it.,iPhone 12,30999

Had to get used to it initially üôÇ..Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took the 128GB variant, just so that i don‚Äôt have to backup to PC too often...Battery lasts a day, it drains a bit faster on weekdays when I use its Mobile hotspot for office work. No connectivity issues though...Few pics attached. Night shots look much better on iPhone 12...No charging brick in the box. But works with my old iPhones charger/cable. I still ordered 20W fast charging brick separately from Apple site though. And it does charge pretty fast...Flipkart delivery: Had done pre booking on the day they made it available on Flipkart. Awesome discount and old phone buy back offered. Had initial promised delivery date of 1st Nov, but got delivered on 4th Nov.

5,Awesome,"Switched from Android to iPhone and this transition was really smooth due to its easier GUI. I bought this 128 Gb variant and Didn‚Äôt waited for iPhone 13 as iPhone 12 has all ,what one need in a perfect phone. In person white colour seems much sexier than purple and black.

5,Great product,"First time in my life I'm trying iphone, I'm an android Samsung note user. There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single handed use, power of A14 bionic chip and the awesome cameras. Luckily this 12 unlike iPhone 11 has amoled screen and it looks crisp and vivid. Battery life has amazed me with easily 1.5 days of usage on any given day. It doesn't have fast charging like android but I can live with it. Final verdict, I dont regret choosing this phone.",iPhone 12,30999

It's gives the phone a premium look. Sometimes you cannot say it's white or green since the shade of green is like that...Camera: Performance in day light is unparalleled. Night photography could be better but still beats most phones in this price range. Selfie camera is best in segment. Videography is excellent...Battery life: Will last for a day on full charge. Doesn't charge as fast as its android counterparts...Processor: A14 bionic chipset is blazing fast. It unleashes its capabilities thanks to optimised OS...Things to like:.- Performs well at any task you throw at it..- Camera is seriously PRO..- Apps run well. No crashes...Things not to like:.- Price, obviously. Though justified but still out of reach for many..- Limited customization..- No type C or headphone jack nor charger given along..-",iPhone 12,30999

5,Super!,My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios..Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great...Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour...The display is gorgeous. One of the best.,iPhone 12,30999

4,Value-for-money,I always bought a android flagship device but i was very dissapointed because they all lag or record low fps video in third party apps that's is why switched to IOS now i m happy with the performance and also it's not bulky because it's a 6.1 inch display phone which is very easy to carry.Big thumbs up for thatüëçüëçüëç,iPhone 12,30999

There are better display panels in market with Lil higher range like One plus 12 or Realme GT6 or Xiaomi 13 phones...Infact Vivo V40 display is tuned differently and is better than T3 ultra...Some bloatware available but can be uninstalled...Cooling mgmt is much better than many phones...This is not a Camera phone but that's okay. Edit your pictures or videos later...Best part about phone is it's very comfortable for hands. Your fingers (Pinky) or thumb or any other doesn't get strained...Meditek processor giving smooth experience..Speakers are also good...No Dolby or HDR display on OTTs like Netflix...Overall value for money.,vivo T3 Ultra,35999

5,Just wow!,Almost impossible to take a bad shot with this phone. Completely loved it !,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Brilliant,"I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons..Pro:.1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation..2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates..3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email..4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone..Cons:.1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow..2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well..3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find..4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes..Update after 1 month:.1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging..2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure..3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone..Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Just wow!,Good camera.AI features editor amazing,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Wonderful,Love it so much üòç.I think Design is better than other phone.Only needed camera pro mode,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Must buy!,"I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. ü§ó I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! ü•∞ Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!üôè",Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Pretty good,"My first device has damaged and then I got a complete replacement through F1 info solutions. It's been a month of usage, I'm facing serious heating issues and battery draining. Afterall, it's beast especially for camera, vibration motor, crispy display.overall phenomenal experience üòç",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Terrific purchase,Very premium looking and compact. Good camera and filled with amazing ai features!!!! Overall very balanced phoneüíô.,Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Worth the money,Probably the best android phone in terms of user expirience..Lots of things to learn.camera captures real photos..Only issue is phone heating on the side aluminium panel which is really annoying considering its winter in india..I will post another review in a month after heavy gaming.,Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Worth the money,Overall it's a good premium stock Android phone...Battery heats up (when exposed in the direct sun) sometimes and slows down the charging speed...Otherwise it's a smooth and top notch phone as you expect from a Pixel device.,Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Value-for-money,"Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price..Pros:-..Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with...Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates..Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone..Cons:-..Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me...Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Brilliant,"I recently upgraded from iPhone 14 to Google Pixel 8. And it's worth every penny..Don't hesitate and just go for it, without any second thought.",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Highly recommended,I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Fabulous!,"Perfect size phone for a compact phone user. Hazel color looks amazing..It has the best display on a phone in the world(check DXOMark rating)..The phone is quick and the touch is amazing!.Battery life is decent considering display quality and the brightness..I'm yes and to test the camera, but pixel never disappoints in that genreüòÜ",Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Nice product,"Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone).The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples..The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures..The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem..AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better..So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight....HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day..The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable..The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest...I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either...All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Perfect product!,"The phone is excellent. No heating, but it does get ever so slightly warm but no where close to how hot tensor G1 and G2 got.performance is top notch. Haptic on this phone is ultimate it's way better than any other phone including iphones. Display is beautiful. This time Google nailed it. Feels very premium.",Google Pixel 8,38999

5,Highly recommended,One of the best cameras you can get on Android phones,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Fabulous!,"An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years...I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up...Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.",Google Pixel 8,38999

5,Great product,It's too early for review but this is based on first few days experience. 7 years of OS and security updates was pleasant and unexpected. I was a fan since Nexus series but now with the Pixel series specifically Pixel 8 they did a major upgrade complementing with AI and photography. Google has always been champ of OS and now they are excelling Hardware also combining AI and Photography. Cheers.,Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Nice product,"Absolutely stunning phone in this price range. Good performance, awesome camera and display. Showstopper of BBD sale.",Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Delightful,"As we all know if bought in India we don't get much of the AI Magic üòî...Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience...Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left...When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there...So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.",Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Really Nice,"I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Really Nice,"Phone gets warm during basic tasks, battery life is also not that great imo..Update: most issues fixed after software update.",Google Pixel 8,38999
3,Nice,"Upgraded from Vivo y50 to pixel 8..1. Performance - Great.2. Camera - definitely better than apple in colour quality but have to improve in blur and potrait mode.3. Battery - after 90% charge it will give you 1 day battery life easily.4. Design - The Best in world.5. Display - it's too good..Bonus point (TiP).Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger...Please don't go for ambrane charger.Will regret like me and ambrane charger don't even give refund.",Google Pixel 8,38999

3,Does the job,"Bought it during the big billion sale.This is my first premium mobile, liked the design and it's easy for single hand use.Display is good, haptics are good.Camera is decent ..have not explored too much.Heats up during video calls.Battery is a big disappointment, have to charge twice a day.Don't buy this mobile, thinking it has a 7 yr upgrade and it's premium looks, not worth it.And not worth paying 60k plus.Premium Chinese phones at 40k are way better",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Great product,No nonsense phone. Great camera performance..Best compact phone with the best of Google features..Cherry on the top - OS support till 7 years,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Awesome,"Great Camera, Great Specs, I'm Switched IPHONE XR to PIXEL 8. Pixel Experience is Brilliant. Worth Buying. Yes, Price is Kind of Higher than other phone. But when u use this device, Then U feel like holding a Real flagship device better than S23 and iPhone 14. Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100. Which is very dissapointing.",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Excellent,"Nice phone. Camera is simply awesome.Performance is smooth. No or minimal heating issue which might be solved by further updates. Battery backup is ok,if you are a normal user. Charging is faster with Google 30 w adapter.Not to be recommended for gamers..Overall performance is very good. Certainly you should go for it.",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Perfect product!,I'm not sure why there is so much negative talk about the product outside or even in Flipkart reviews about heating.My device didn't heat up much yes there is a slight warmth in extensive usage that I observed in the iPhone too..Secondly I liked the pixel because of the AI dude this is way smatter than iPhone in most of the aspects..Finally it's up to you to make a decision.If you want a smarter phone way smatter than apple then pixel is best..7 years of software updates and security patch that's insane,Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Pretty good,Awesome pers,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Fabulous!,I will say if u don't play games and not a very heavy addictive user of phone then u can go blindly for it. The camera never disappoints you the screen makes you fall in love and it's haptic feedback and vibration motor... I will just say I love it ... U may find a lot of negative feedback and comments about the phone but it's not the way as they show it's far better and at the price in BBD sale it will be an insane buy to get it.,Google Pixel 8,38999

5,Best in the market!,Well I got it is with exchange of my old phone. Have been using OnePlus devices from last siz years...This phone has been working fine for me from last 15 days. I saw people talking about battery period. I found it similar to previous phone. Full charge giving me a full day battery as per my usage..The camera is good. Taking beautiful pictures at low light. Other AI features are also fine but haven't used those completely...Not facing a heating issue as mentioned by many reviews..Overall good huy,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Awesome,"The rounded aluminium sides and curved glass back feel nice and are easy to hold.New generative AI features including various image and video editing tools, new abilities for its voice assistant. Overall best Android phone ever launched . Futuristic üöÄ",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Simply awesome,Value for money.Contemporary of iPhone in Android,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Worth every penny,Really good üíØüòä product. Much better than iPhone. While looking and having the phone in hand doesn't feel like having a costlier mobile.but using its features makes unique and stand a step for the pixels.,Google Pixel 8,38999

3,Nice,Couldn't connect with jio 5,Google Pixel 8,38999
3,Fair,Good but not as good as Samsung flagships in all areas except photos and videos...,Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Classy product,"I have been using stock Android for almost 10 years, moto nexus ,in note 2 , Motorola etc.... here are some cons of pixel 8.1)battery doesn't last for full day with moderate use..2)camera pop up design makes the mobile feel heavier.3)save passwords error as instead of login Id it shows password.4)Gemini ai can do better..Good points.Display is just awesome for HDR videos and daily use.Sound is good.Quick charging for first 50%.User friendly interface.Camera just tooo good.Overall good mobile for daily use but at such price one has more expectations for battery life atleast",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Highly recommended,"Google has an overall winner with pixel 8..I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone..If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell...Pros:.1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere..2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department..3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use..4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!.5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range..6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight..7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much...Cons:.1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations..2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions..3. Speakers could have been better..4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing..5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that...Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Wonderful,"I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series...The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7...Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)",Google Pixel 8,38999
4,Good choice,"I don't know why people are complaining about battery life and connectivity issues.. I don't have any connectivity issues, I am getting to use this device for a whole day with a single charge.. The camera performance is excellent.. The price is definitely on the higher side but U can compromise for the camera and 7 years of android updates..",Google Pixel 8,38999
3,Fair,"The battery will take 1 hour 45 minutes to charge with the original Google charger..Will gets warm when doing any heavy task and playing games.You need to use the phone with a back cover to avoid the body heating issue...Display,Sound and design is good. Quiet handy phone..Camera clarity is good but zooming is missing in the phone..Strictly for users who love pixel experience others please stay out and better go with other better options",Google Pixel 8,38999
5,Terrific purchase,I purchased it after using iPhone 12 mini for 3 years..Beautiful design. Very elegant looking. Camera is also very nice. Battery doesn't seem to be a major issue to me.

4,Delightful,"After using it for 2 months, I'm writing this that this phone is good for normal users. This is not for heavy users or gamers. You can get around 4 to 5 hours of screen on time and the charging is bit slow. The display is top notch and the camera is also great. But if you come to performance part and if you are performing normal day-to-day task, you will not have any issues.

4,Delightful,"Writing brutally honest review..I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything...I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size...Coming back to my experience...Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous...Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast...Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls...I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase...Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999

4,Worth the price,"EDIT: Review after 17 months usage.There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user..Cons:.1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day..2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive..3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition...Pros.1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny..2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23..3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones..4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time..5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam..6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now...At current market price S23 is highly recommended.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
5,Switched from iphone and i do not regret.,Exchanged iPhone 11 for this. Worth it. Had very bad experience with Android but man this phone is buttery smooth...No heating..Battery is excellent..Ui is clean and easy to use and customise..Small and handy..Very beautiful design..Kudos Samsung.,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999

5,Excellent,Overall very good phone..if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you.

Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy.

Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed...The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging...Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone.

4,Good choice,"After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming..One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999

5,Great product,"I purchased this phone on Flipkart GOAT sale. Got it in 47k 256 gb variant. Using it for almost a month..1. Camera , display, performance is quite impressive..2. I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp...3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series...S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best...Very happy with this purchase..I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get...Hope this review helps.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999

5,Worth every penny,One of the best phones money can buy. But you will be left wanting for bigger battery and fast charging. 8/10,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
5,Simply awesome,"I have been using this mobile for a while now. Here's my honest review based on my experience...Battery Performance: The battery life on this mobile is quite impressive under moderate usage. It easily lasts a full day. However, I noticed that when using the 5G network, the battery drains heavily. This is common for all phones not a Samsung issue...Design and Build: The slim design of the mobile is a major plus point. It fells comfortable to hold and is suitable for single hand usage. However, I noticed that the paint on aluminium frame is starting to wear off, which is disappointing. It's something that Samsung should address for better durability...Camera: The camera, especially when using the portrait mode, captures good images with nice depth of field. However, I did notice a lack of clarity when zooming in on subjects...Expert Raw Option: For photography enthusiasts or professionals, the expert RAW option is a standout feature. It provides more control and flexibility over the image settings, allowing for advanced editing and post- processing...I hope this review helps you make an informed decision. Happy shopping!",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
3,Good,"Product is good.Cons: While using cam heating issue.Battery back up less.When we bought with 70K they should provide case and charming adoptor, but no case no charging adopotor..Pros: processor, cam, display, design, looks premium...Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers...So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
4,Really Nice,Best compact phone but there's no any update for VoNR yet. Only issue with Samsung flagships is that their fingerprint doesn't work well with any tempered glass.,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
5,Brilliant,"It's a great phone to buy if u are looking for compact phone, but dont do the same mistake as I did . buy a thin slim case to enjoy the phones slim bezels . I bought a armored case and now besels looks thick",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
5,Simply awesome,Pros.1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera..2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth..3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated..4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+..5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb..6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.,SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
4,Nice product,"After using for about 1 month; its a fantastic phone.Rather blabbering, i will tell the key points.1. No heating issues.2. Great battery backup; lasts upto 1 day on moderate usage.3. Awesome display and its feel.4. Works flawlessly with galaxy watch 4 and buds 2.5. No lagging.6. Easy to hold in hands.7. Knox is best.8. Camera's potrait and zoom pictures are excellent..But concern is that hope Samsung doesn't slow it down on future updates so as to promote newer galaxies",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
4,Really Nice,"Good,Compact, more battery then expected, best for normal use, better than iPhone 13 or 14, Android has much more power and customization as compared to any other OS. In this scenario samsung s23 is best.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999

5,Super!,"Long term review, moving from apple to samsung..Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably..Camera is good..Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no..Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color..Compared to apple.120 refresh rate is great..We have telephoto zoom..Comparable battery life..No lags while using the phone...Cons:.UI can use some improvements..Picture and picture mode can be improved..Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive)..Battery is good, but it can get better...Will update if i find some more pros and cons.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
5,Awesome,"Camera and overall features are nice. If you are into photography, can download Expert RAW app by Samsung and try to enhance your skills. Night clicks are also coming out quite good. Processor is superfast. Intensive usage is leading to heating but not into an alarming condition. But bit heating is there while you are going all out. Overall size is quite handy which I admire a lot. But the major drawback is the battery which is not upto the mark comparing to I Phone 14.",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
5,Classy product,"Switch from Pixel 7,before that from iPhone 13. My decision of switching was üíØ % correct.If samsung ditched SD chipset in smaller S series than that will be a huge bummer üòî. So far so good but SD chipset in S23 is the original matchmaker.I don't know about Exynos, let's see in coming years. Samsung update policy will keep it afresh I guess !",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
5,Wonderful,"The Samsung Galaxy S23 is a true masterpiece! The moment I held it in my hands, I knew I was in for a treat. The 6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED display is simply breathtaking, with colors that pop and a level of detail that's hard to believe. The 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and gaming incredibly smooth, and the HDR10+ support brings videos to life like never before...But it's not just about looks - the S23 also packs a punch when it comes to performance. The 3900mAh battery easily lasts a full day, and the fast charging capabilities get you back up and running in no time. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor is a beast, handling even the most demanding tasks with ease...Other standout features include the impressive 50MP camera system, complete with advanced features like Super Steady video stabilization and support for 8K video recording. And with Samsung's One UI software, you get a clean, intuitive interface that makes it easy to find what you need and get things done...Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is a powerhouse of a phone that checks all the boxes. Whether you're a gamer, a photographer, or just someone who wants a great all-around device, this phone is a must-have. Five stars and a big thumbs up from me!",SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,39999
